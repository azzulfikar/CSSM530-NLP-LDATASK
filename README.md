# Unpacking ‘Perceptions’: A Deep Dive into the Discourse Surrounding the Turkish Education System

This study embarks on a journey into the public's perceptions of the Turkish education system, a topic that has yet to be fully explored in existing literature. By employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze data from Ekşi Sözlük, a popular Turkish online forum, we aim to delve into society's views on the education system, its perceived issues, and the proposed solutions. This exploration will help us understand the societal connotations of 'education' and the 'education system.' Our project adopts a data-driven and exploratory approach, for trying to minimize bias and allowing the data to guide our understanding. Although we acknowledge potential limitations due to the complexity of the data and the exploratory nature of our study, our main focus is to gain a comprehensive understanding of public perceptions on education-related issues in Türkiye. Furthermore, this paper provides beginner-friendly insights into the practical application of LDA as a tool in Natural Language Processing (NLP), highlighting its capabilities and constraints in analyzing public discourse.
